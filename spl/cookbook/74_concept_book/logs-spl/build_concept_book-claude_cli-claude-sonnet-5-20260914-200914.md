## Amortized Analysis

Some algorithms perform a sequence of operations where individual steps occasionally cost a lot, but expensive steps happen rarely enough that the *average* cost per operation stays low. Amortized analysis is the technique for proving that average bound rigorously — not by assuming a favorable input distribution (that would be average-case analysis, a probabilistic claim), but by guaranteeing that over *any* sequence of $n$ operations, the total work is bounded by $O(f(n))$, so each operation costs $O(f(n)/n)$ amortized, no matter the order of operations an adversary chooses.

**Worked example: dynamic array doubling.** Consider a resizable array (like Python's `list` or C++'s `vector`) that starts with capacity 1 and doubles its capacity whenever it fills up, copying all existing elements into the new array. A single `append` that triggers a resize costs $O(n)$ — expensive. But how often does that happen? After $n$ appends, resizes occur only at sizes $1, 2, 4, 8, \dots$, so the total copying cost is $\sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 n} 2^i < 2n$. Adding the $n$ ordinary $O(1)$ appends, the total cost for $n$ operations is $O(n)$, giving an amortized cost of $O(1)$ per append — even though some individual appends cost $O(n)$.

**Formal justification — the accounting method.** To make this rigorous, assign each operation an *amortized cost* $\hat{c}_i$, chosen so that $\sum \hat{c}_i \geq \sum c_i$ (actual costs) for every prefix of the sequence. For array doubling, charge each append $\$3$: $\$1$ pays for inserting the element itself, and $\$2$ is banked as credit on that element. When a resize of size $n$ occurs, exactly $n/2$ elements have accumulated $\$2$ each — the "credit" saved from insertions since the last resize — covering the $O(n)$ copy cost exactly. Since credit never goes negative, the amortized bound holds for *any* sequence of operations, not just favorable ones.

**Application.** This same reasoning — accounting or the related potential-function method — proves $O(1)$ amortized cost for hash table resizing, $O(\log n)$ amortized cost for splay tree operations, and $O(1)$ amortized cost for the union-find data structure's path compression. Recognizing when a data structure's worst case is misleadingly pessimistic, and proving the tighter amortized bound instead, is essential for evaluating real-world performance claims.

## Backing Array

A dynamic array (Python's `list`, Java's `ArrayList`, C++'s `std::vector`) presents an interface that grows and shrinks freely, but underneath it sits on a *backing array*: a fixed-size, contiguous block of memory of some capacity $c$. A separate integer $n$, the logical size, tracks how many of those $c$ slots actually hold valid elements, with $n \le c$. The gap between $n$ and $c$ is intentional slack that absorbs future insertions without forcing a reallocation on every single append.

**Worked example.** Suppose a backing array has capacity $c = 8$ and currently holds $n = 5$ elements: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, _, _, _]`, where the last three slots are unused memory. Appending `9` simply writes into index 5 and increments $n$ to 6 — an $O(1)$ operation, since no new memory is allocated and no existing elements move. This is the entire performance benefit of the backing array: as long as $n < c$, appends are cheap. Only when $n$ reaches $c$ does the structure need to allocate a new, larger backing array and copy every element over, an $O(n)$ operation.

**Problem-solving application.** The design question this raises is: how much should the backing array grow when it fills up? Growing by a fixed amount (say, always adding 10 slots) seems safe but is actually a trap — if you append $n$ elements one at a time, you trigger a reallocation every 10 appends, and each reallocation costs $O(n)$, giving total cost $O(n^2)$. The standard fix is *geometric growth*: when capacity is exhausted, replace the backing array with one of size $2c$ (or $1.5c$, depending on the implementation). This makes reallocations increasingly rare as the array grows, and an amortized analysis shows the total cost of $n$ appends is $O(n)$ — averaging to $O(1)$ per append despite occasional expensive resizes.

This is why understanding the backing array matters for practice, not just theory: it explains why `list.append` in Python is fast on average but can spike in latency, why pre-allocating capacity (e.g., `list(capacity)` constructors, or reserving space when the final size is known) avoids wasted copying, and why inserting at the *front* of a dynamic array is $O(n)$ — every existing element must shift one slot over in the backing array to make room, unlike appending at the back.

## List Interface

The **List interface** describes an abstract data type that maintains a sequence of $n$ elements, indexed $0$ through $n-1$, and supports four fundamental operations:

- $\text{get}(i)$ — return the element stored at index $i$
- $\text{set}(i, x)$ — replace the element at index $i$ with $x$
- $\text{add}(i, x)$ — insert $x$ at index $i$, shifting subsequent elements right
- $\text{remove}(i)$ — delete the element at index $i$, shifting subsequent elements left

Crucially, the interface specifies *what* these operations do, not *how* they are implemented. Different data structures — arrays, linked lists, skip lists — all satisfy the List interface, but they achieve wildly different running times for each operation. This is the core insight of studying data structures via interfaces: the interface fixes correctness and behavior; the implementation determines efficiency.

**Worked example.** Consider an array-backed list `A = [10, 20, 30, 40]`. Calling $\text{get}(2)$ returns $30$ in $O(1)$ time, since arrays support direct indexing by memory offset. Calling $\text{add}(1, 99)$ must shift elements at indices $1, 2, 3$ rightward to make room, producing `[10, 99, 20, 30, 40]` — an $O(n)$ operation in the worst case, because up to $n$ elements may need to move. A linked-list implementation flips this trade-off: $\text{add}(i, x)$ can be $O(1)$ once you've located position $i$ (just relink two pointers), but $\text{get}(i)$ costs $O(n)$, since there's no way to jump directly to index $i$ without walking the chain from the head.

**Problem-solving application.** When you're handed a problem, the List interface tells you what operations you're allowed to use, but choosing the right *backing structure* is the actual engineering decision. Ask: which operations dominate? A text editor's undo buffer, which frequently inserts and deletes near the cursor but rarely does random access, favors a linked list. A lookup table accessed by position millions of times per second, with few insertions, favors an array. Recognizing that a problem is "really" a List problem — abstracting away irrelevant details to see that you just need get/set/add/remove — is often the first and most valuable step in choosing an efficient algorithm, before you commit to any specific implementation.

## Resize Operation

A dynamic array (such as Python's `list` or Java's `ArrayList`) presents the illusion of arbitrary growth, but underneath it holds a fixed-size backing array. When an insertion would exceed that capacity, the structure performs a **resize**: it allocates a new backing array — typically double the current capacity — copies every existing element into it, and then completes the insertion. A symmetric shrink can happen when the array becomes sparse (e.g., dropping below one-quarter full), halving capacity to reclaim memory. This operation is what makes dynamic arrays "dynamic" while still offering the fast, indexed access of a plain array.

**Worked example.** Suppose a backing array has capacity 4 and is full: `[3, 7, 1, 9]`. Appending `5` triggers a resize: allocate a new array of capacity 8, copy the four elements over, then insert `5` at index 4, yielding `[3, 7, 1, 9, 5, _, _, _]`. The next three appends are cheap — no copying needed — until capacity 8 fills, prompting a resize to 16.

**Why doubling, not adding a fixed amount?** This is where the concept demands formal analysis. If capacity grew by a constant $c$ each time, inserting $n$ elements would trigger $n/c$ resizes, and the $k$-th resize copies $O(k \cdot c)$ elements, giving total copying work $\sum_{k=1}^{n/c} kc = O(n^2/c)$ — quadratic. Doubling instead makes resizes exponentially rarer: the $i$-th resize (capacity $2^i$) copies $2^i$ elements, and resizes occur at sizes $1, 2, 4, \dots, n$. Total copying cost is $\sum_{i=0}^{\log_2 n} 2^i = 2^{\lceil \log_2 n \rceil + 1} - 1 = O(n)$, a geometric series dominated by its last term. Spread over $n$ insertions, this gives **amortized $O(1)$** per append — even though any single append can cost $O(n)$ in the worst case.

**Problem-solving application.** This amortized-cost argument, called the *accounting* or *potential method*, generalizes: whenever an expensive operation is triggered rarely enough that its cost can be "paid off" by cheap operations preceding it, you get good amortized bounds despite bad worst-case bounds. Recognizing this pattern lets you correctly analyze structures like hash tables (which resize their bucket arrays the same way) instead of mistakenly assuming every insertion is $O(n)$.

## Array Stack

An **array stack** implements the List interface using a single backing array `a` together with a size counter `n` tracking how many of the array's slots hold valid elements. Because array indexing is direct memory-offset access, `get(i)` and `set(i, x)` run in $O(1)$ time — the position of element $i$ is computed as `base_address + i * element_size`, requiring no traversal.

Insertion and removal are more delicate. To `add(i, x)`, every element at index $i$ or later must shift one slot to the right to make room, then `a[i] = x`. Removal shifts elements left to close the gap. Both operations cost $O(1 + n - i)$: constant work plus the number of elements that must move. Inserting or removing near the end (large $i$) is cheap; near the beginning (small $i$) is expensive, since almost the whole array shifts.

The remaining challenge is that the backing array has fixed capacity. When `n` reaches the array's length, `add` cannot proceed until the array grows. The standard technique is **array doubling**: allocate a new array of twice the size, copy all $n$ elements over, then continue. Symmetrically, if $n$ shrinks to a quarter of the capacity, the array is halved to reclaim space. Though a single doubling costs $O(n)$, it happens rarely enough that its cost, spread — or *amortized* — over the sequence of operations, adds only $O(1)$ per `add`/`remove` on average.

**Worked example.** Suppose an array stack holds `[3, 7, 1, 9]` with capacity 4. Calling `add(4, 5)` (append) triggers doubling: a new array of capacity 8 is allocated, `[3, 7, 1, 9]` is copied in, then `5` is placed at index 4, giving `[3, 7, 1, 9, 5]`. A later `add(1, 2)` requires shifting `9, 1, 7`... rather, shifting elements from index 1 onward right by one, costing $O(1 + n - 1) = O(n)$ for that single call, since $i$ is small.

**Problem-solving application.** When choosing between an array stack and a linked list for a List ADT, examine the access pattern: if the workload is dominated by appends/removals at the tail (as in a stack) or by random `get`/`set` calls, array stacks are optimal. If the workload frequently inserts or deletes near the front or middle, the $O(n)$ shifting cost makes a linked structure preferable. The amortized-doubling analysis also generalizes: any data structure that grows/shrinks by a constant factor rather than a constant amount achieves amortized $O(1)$ resizing cost — a pattern reused in dynamic arrays across virtually every standard library.

## Fast Array Stack

A `FastArrayStack` implements the same interface as an ordinary array-backed stack — `push`, `pop`, `resize` — but replaces every element-by-element loop that moves data with a single call to a bulk array-copy primitive, such as Java's `System.arraycopy` or C's `memmove`. The interface and the amortized-cost guarantees are unchanged; what changes is the constant factor hidden inside "the work of copying $n$ elements."

**Why the constant matters.** In a naive implementation, doubling the backing array or shifting elements after a `pop` at an arbitrary index is written as a `for` loop that copies one element per iteration. Each iteration pays for a bounds check, an index increment, and a memory read/write — overhead the JIT compiler or hardware cannot always eliminate. A bulk-copy intrinsic instead compiles down to a tight, vectorized memory-move routine (often using SIMD instructions or a single `memmove` syscall-level call) that the CPU can execute at close to peak memory bandwidth. The asymptotic bound is identical — copying $n$ elements is still $\Theta(n)$ — but the hidden constant $c$ in $c \cdot n$ can shrink by a factor of 5–10x in practice.

**Worked example.** Consider `resize()`, called when the array of capacity $m$ is full and must grow to $2m$. The naive version:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) newArray[i] = oldArray[i];
```
The fast version:
```java
System.arraycopy(oldArray, 0, newArray, 0, n);
```
Both perform $n$ element copies, so the amortized cost of $n$ pushes remains $O(1)$ per operation (the standard doubling argument: total copying cost over $n$ pushes is $\sum 2^i \le 2n$, i.e. $O(n)$ total, $O(1)$ amortized). The fast version simply reduces the per-element constant.

**Problem-solving application.** When you profile a stack-heavy algorithm (e.g., balanced-parenthesis checking on gigabyte-scale input, or an undo-buffer in an editor) and find that array shifting dominates runtime despite already having correct $O(1)$ amortized bounds, the fix is not a smarter algorithm — it's swapping loop-based shifts for `arraycopy`/`memmove` calls. This is a valuable lesson in complexity analysis: Big-$O$ tells you how cost scales, not how fast the code runs at a fixed $n$; engineering performance work happens in the constants that asymptotic analysis deliberately ignores.

## Payoff

The `fast_array_stack` is where amortized analysis stops being an abstract accounting trick and becomes the reason large-scale software is fast at all. A stack backed by a fixed-size array is trivial to implement, but it forces an uncomfortable choice: either overallocate memory you may never use, or resize on every push and pay an $O(n)$ copy cost per operation. The doubling strategy — resize by a constant factor $c > 1$ whenever the array fills — resolves this. Although any single resize costs $O(n)$, the total cost of $n$ pushes starting from an empty array is bounded by
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{\log_c n} c^k = O\!\left(\frac{c}{c-1} \cdot n\right) = O(n),
$$
a geometric series dominated by its last term. Dividing by $n$ operations gives an amortized cost of $O(1)$ per push — not because every operation is fast, but because the rare expensive ones are paid for by the many cheap ones that preceded them. This is the endpoint of the chapter because it is the first structure where correctness (get the right answer) and efficiency (get it fast, on average, no matter the sequence of operations) are proven together using the same argument — the potential function $\Phi = 2 \cdot \text{size} - \text{capacity}$ that tracks "banked" work.

This idea propagates directly into the applications this book has been building toward. Dynamic arrays underlie every language's built-in resizable container — Python's `list`, Java's `ArrayList`, C++'s `std::vector` — so understanding `fast_array_stack` means understanding what your code actually does under the hood every time you `.append()`. Call stacks in interpreters and compilers, which must grow and shrink with recursion depth, rely on exactly this amortized-doubling discipline to avoid either wasting memory or stalling on every call. Undo/redo systems in editors, backtracking search in AI and combinatorial algorithms, and expression evaluators in parsers all push and pop at high frequency, and their real-time responsiveness depends on the $O(1)$ amortized guarantee rather than worst-case-per-operation reasoning.

From here, the natural next step is to open the source of a language runtime you use daily — CPython's `listobject.c` is a good target — and locate its actual growth factor. Compare it to the $c=2$ idealization above, and ask why real systems often choose $c \approx 1.125$ instead: what does the amortized-cost proof say about that trade-off between wasted memory and resize frequency?
