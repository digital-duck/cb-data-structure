## Backing Array

A dynamic array (Python's `list`, Java's `ArrayList`, C++'s `std::vector`) presents an interface that grows and shrinks freely, but underneath it sits on a *backing array*: a fixed-size, contiguous block of memory of some capacity $c$. A separate integer $n$, the logical size, tracks how many of those $c$ slots actually hold valid elements, with $n \le c$. The gap between $n$ and $c$ is intentional slack that absorbs future insertions without forcing a reallocation on every single append.

**Worked example.** Suppose a backing array has capacity $c = 8$ and currently holds $n = 5$ elements: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, _, _, _]`, where the last three slots are unused memory. Appending `9` simply writes into index 5 and increments $n$ to 6 — an $O(1)$ operation, since no new memory is allocated and no existing elements move. This is the entire performance benefit of the backing array: as long as $n < c$, appends are cheap. Only when $n$ reaches $c$ does the structure need to allocate a new, larger backing array and copy every element over, an $O(n)$ operation.

**Problem-solving application.** The design question this raises is: how much should the backing array grow when it fills up? Growing by a fixed amount (say, always adding 10 slots) seems safe but is actually a trap — if you append $n$ elements one at a time, you trigger a reallocation every 10 appends, and each reallocation costs $O(n)$, giving total cost $O(n^2)$. The standard fix is *geometric growth*: when capacity is exhausted, replace the backing array with one of size $2c$ (or $1.5c$, depending on the implementation). This makes reallocations increasingly rare as the array grows, and an amortized analysis shows the total cost of $n$ appends is $O(n)$ — averaging to $O(1)$ per append despite occasional expensive resizes.

This is why understanding the backing array matters for practice, not just theory: it explains why `list.append` in Python is fast on average but can spike in latency, why pre-allocating capacity (e.g., `list(capacity)` constructors, or reserving space when the final size is known) avoids wasted copying, and why inserting at the *front* of a dynamic array is $O(n)$ — every existing element must shift one slot over in the backing array to make room, unlike appending at the back.

## Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is arithmetic on remainders. For an integer $a$ and a positive integer $n$ (the *modulus*), we define

$$a \bmod n = r, \quad \text{where } a = qn + r, \; 0 \le r < n, \; q = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{n} \right\rfloor.$$

Two integers $a$ and $b$ are *congruent modulo* $n$, written $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$, if they leave the same remainder when divided by $n$ — equivalently, if $n$ divides $a - b$. Congruence is an equivalence relation: it partitions all integers into exactly $n$ classes, $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$, and addition, subtraction, and multiplication all respect it: if $a \equiv b$ and $c \equiv d \pmod n$, then $a+c \equiv b+d$ and $ac \equiv bd \pmod n$. This is what makes modular arithmetic a genuine algebraic structure (the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$), not just a bookkeeping trick.

**Worked example.** Compute $47 \bmod 7$. Since $47 = 6 \cdot 7 + 5$, we get $47 \bmod 7 = 5$. Now compute $(-3) \bmod 7$: because $-3 = (-1)\cdot 7 + 4$, the remainder is $4$, not $-3$ — a subtlety that matters in programming, since some languages (C, Java) return $-3 \bmod 7 = -3$, while mathematically consistent "floored" modulo returns $4$. Python's `%` operator follows the floored convention, matching the mathematical definition above.

**Problem-solving application: circular indexing.** Suppose an array `arr` has length $n$, and you want to move an index `i` forward by `k` positions, wrapping past the end back to the start — this is exactly how ring buffers, circular queues, and hash-table probing work. The wrapped index is
$$i' = (i + k) \bmod n.$$
For example, with $n = 5$ and $i = 3$, advancing by $k = 4$ gives $i' = (3+4) \bmod 5 = 7 \bmod 5 = 2$: index 3 moves forward 4 steps, wraps around the end, and lands on index 2. This single formula replaces a fragile chain of conditional checks (`if index >= length, subtract length`) with one arithmetic expression that is correct for any offset, including negative ones, provided you use the floored-modulo convention. This is the core idea behind circular buffers in operating systems, round-robin scheduling, and hashing schemes where a key's bucket is computed as `hash(key) mod table_size`.

## Circular Array

A circular array simulates an unbounded, wrap-around sequence using a fixed-size block of memory. Instead of allocating new space when an array "runs out of room" at its end, a circular array reuses the freed slots at its beginning. The mechanism is modular arithmetic: for an array of capacity $n$, the physical index corresponding to logical position $i$ is

$$
\text{index}(i) = i \bmod n.
$$

Because the remainder of division by $n$ always lies in $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$, any integer $i$ — no matter how large — maps back into valid bounds. This is what makes the array behave as if it wraps: incrementing past index $n-1$ returns to index $0$.

The structure is defined by two pointers, `head` and `tail`, plus a `count` of active elements. Enqueuing appends at `tail` and sets `tail = (tail + 1) mod n`; dequeuing removes from `head` and sets `head = (head + 1) mod n`. The array is full when `count == n` and empty when `count == 0` — tracking `count` explicitly avoids the ambiguity of `head == tail` meaning either "empty" or "full."

**Worked example.** Suppose $n = 5$, and we perform: enqueue A, B, C (head = 0, tail = 3, count = 3); dequeue twice (head = 2, count = 1); enqueue D, E, F. The third enqueue computes `tail = (4 + 1) mod 5 = 0`, placing F at physical index 0 — the slot vacated by A. The array's logical order (C, D, E, F) is preserved even though the elements physically wrap around the end.

**Problem-solving application.** Circular arrays are the standard implementation for queues, ring buffers in streaming I/O, and fixed-window algorithms (e.g., a sliding-window maximum over the last $k$ elements, or a circular buffer feeding an audio device in real time). The key design decision is choosing $n$: too small forces overwrites or blocking; too large wastes memory. A common interview task is: "Implement a queue with $O(1)$ enqueue/dequeue using a fixed array" — the solution is exactly this modular-index scheme, since a naive array-shifting queue costs $O(n)$ per dequeue. Recognizing when a problem exhibits a fixed-capacity, FIFO-with-eviction pattern is the signal to reach for a circular array rather than a dynamic list.
