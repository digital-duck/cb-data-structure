## Node

A **node** is the basic unit of a linked data structure: a small container holding a data value together with one or more references (pointers) to other nodes. Where an array stores its elements in contiguous memory and locates them by arithmetic on an index, a node-based structure scatters its elements across memory and stitches them together explicitly through these references. This trade-off — giving up constant-time random access in exchange for constant-time insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions — is the reason nodes underlie structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.

Formally, a node can be defined as a record type:

$$
\text{Node} = \langle \text{data}, \; \text{next}_1, \text{next}_2, \dots, \text{next}_k \rangle
$$

For a **singly linked list**, $k = 1$: each node holds one value and one reference to the next node, with the final node's reference set to a sentinel value, typically `null` or `None`, marking the end of the chain. A **doubly linked list** node has $k=2$ (`next` and `prev`), and a **binary tree** node also has $k=2$, but the references are interpreted as `left` and `right` children rather than a sequence.

In Python, a singly linked list node is commonly implemented as:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

head = Node(3, Node(7, Node(12, None)))
```

Here `head` refers to the first node; each node reaches the next one via its `next` attribute, and traversal means repeatedly following that reference until `next` is `None`.

Problem-solving with nodes centers on manipulating these references correctly, since a single misdirected pointer can silently corrupt the structure or create an infinite loop. Consider inserting a new node with value `x` immediately after a given node `p` in a singly linked list:

```python
def insert_after(p, x):
    new_node = Node(x, p.next)
    p.next = new_node
```

The order matters: the new node's `next` must be set to `p.next` *before* `p.next` is overwritten, or the rest of the list would be lost. This pattern — capture the old reference, redirect the new node, then redirect the predecessor — generalizes to deletion, reversal, and cycle detection, all of which reduce to careful bookkeeping of node references rather than arithmetic on positions.

## Pointer Reference

A pointer reference is a value stored inside a node that identifies the location of another node, rather than storing data directly. Formally, if a node $n$ has fields for data and one or more references, a reference field $\text{next}(n)$ holds the memory address of another node $m$, denoted $\text{next}(n) = \text{addr}(m)$. This is the mechanism that turns isolated blocks of memory into a connected structure: a linked list is precisely the set of nodes $\{n_0, n_1, \dots, n_{k-1}\}$ together with the relation $\text{next}(n_i) = n_{i+1}$ for $0 \le i < k-1$, and $\text{next}(n_{k-1}) = \text{null}$, where $\text{null}$ is a distinguished value meaning "no further node." Unlike an array, where element $i$ is located by arithmetic on a base address ($\text{addr} + i \times \text{size}$), a linked structure has no such formula — the only way to reach node $n_i$ is to start at $n_0$ and follow $i$ pointer references in sequence. This is why traversal is $O(n)$ while insertion or deletion at a known node is $O(1)$: you are rewiring a reference, not shifting memory.

**Worked example.** Consider building a singly linked list from the values $[5, 12, 7]$. Each node is a pair (data, next):
$$n_0 = (5, \text{addr}(n_1)), \quad n_1 = (12, \text{addr}(n_2)), \quad n_2 = (7, \text{null})$$
A `head` reference points to $n_0$. To insert the value $9$ between $n_0$ and $n_1$, create a new node $n_3 = (9, \text{addr}(n_1))$, then update $n_0$'s reference: $\text{next}(n_0) \leftarrow \text{addr}(n_3)$. No data was moved — only two pointer values changed. Compare this to an array insertion at the same logical position, which requires shifting every subsequent element down by one, an $O(n)$ operation.

**Problem-solving application.** Suppose you must detect whether a linked list contains a cycle (some node's reference eventually points back to an earlier node instead of to $\text{null}$). Using two references, `slow` and `fast`, advance `slow` one node per step and `fast` two nodes per step. If the list is acyclic, `fast` reaches $\text{null}$ first. If a cycle exists, `fast` will eventually equal `slow` again, since it gains one node of distance on `slow` each step within a finite cycle — this is Floyd's cycle-detection argument, and it relies entirely on the fact that pointer equality, not data equality, identifies the shared node.

## Dllist

A **doubly linked list (dllist)** is a linear data structure in which every node holds three fields: a data element, a reference to the *next* node, and a reference to the *previous* node. This bidirectional linking distinguishes it from a singly linked list, where each node points only forward. Formally, a dllist of $n$ nodes can be described as a sequence $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}$ with two functions, $\text{next}(v_i) = v_{i+1}$ and $\text{prev}(v_i) = v_{i-1}$, defined for $0 \le i \le n-2$ and $1 \le i \le n-1$ respectively, with $\text{prev}(v_0) = \text{next}(v_{n-1}) = \text{null}$ (or, in a circular variant, wrapping to the opposite end). Maintaining both pointers on every insertion or deletion is the defining bookkeeping cost of the structure.

**Worked example.** Suppose you insert a node $x$ between existing nodes $a$ and $b$ (where $b = \text{next}(a)$). The operation requires four pointer reassignments:

$$
\text{next}(a) \leftarrow x, \quad \text{prev}(x) \leftarrow a, \quad \text{next}(x) \leftarrow b, \quad \text{prev}(b) \leftarrow x
$$

Because you already hold a reference to $a$ (or $x$'s neighbor), no traversal from the head is needed — this is what makes the operation $O(1)$, in contrast to an array, where inserting into the middle costs $O(n)$ due to shifting elements.

**Problem-solving application.** The back-pointer is what makes a dllist the right tool whenever an algorithm needs to delete an arbitrary, already-located node in constant time — for example, implementing an LRU (least-recently-used) cache. There, a hash map stores keys to node references, and the dllist maintains usage order: the most recently accessed node is moved to the front, and the least recently used node (at the tail) is evicted when capacity is exceeded. Removing a node $x$ from anywhere in the list requires only:

$$
\text{next}(\text{prev}(x)) \leftarrow \text{next}(x), \quad \text{prev}(\text{next}(x)) \leftarrow \text{prev}(x)
$$

with the standard boundary checks when $x$ is the head or tail. A singly linked list cannot do this in $O(1)$ time, because deleting $x$ requires knowing its predecessor, which forces an $O(n)$ scan from the head. This trade-off — extra memory per node ($O(n)$ additional pointers) in exchange for $O(1)$ bidirectional traversal and arbitrary-node deletion — is the core design decision to recognize when choosing a dllist over other list variants.

## Sllist

A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node holds a data value and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike an array, whose elements sit in contiguous memory, a linked list's nodes can live anywhere in memory; the chain of `next` pointers is what defines the order. Two special references — `head` and `tail` — track the first and last nodes, so that insertion at either end can be done without traversing the whole list. If a node's `next` field is null, that node marks the end of the sequence.

Formally, a linked list of length $n$ can be modeled as a sequence of nodes $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$, where each $v_i$ stores a value $d_i$ and a pointer $\text{next}(v_i) = v_{i+1}$ for $i < n$, and $\text{next}(v_n) = \text{NULL}$. Access to $v_i$ requires following $i-1$ pointers from `head`, giving $O(i)$ time — there is no direct indexing as with arrays, whose access is $O(1)$. This trade-off is the core reason to choose a linked list: insertion and deletion at a known node take $O(1)$ time (just re-wire pointers), while random access is $O(n)$.

**Worked example.** Suppose `head` points to a node containing 3, whose `next` points to a node containing 7, whose `next` points to a node containing 9, whose `next` is null; `tail` points to the node containing 9. To insert 5 after the node containing 3: create a new node $w$ with $d(w) = 5$; set $\text{next}(w) = \text{next}(v_1)$ (currently the node with 7); set $\text{next}(v_1) = w$. The list is now $3 \to 5 \to 7 \to 9$, and this took a constant number of pointer reassignments, regardless of list length.

**Problem-solving application.** A classic exercise is reversing a singly linked list in place. Maintain three pointers, `prev`, `curr`, and `next_node`. Initialize `prev = NULL`, `curr = head`. While `curr` is not null: save `next_node = next(curr)`, set `next(curr) = prev`, then advance `prev = curr` and `curr = next_node`. After the loop, set `head = prev` (and update `tail` to the old `head`). Each node's pointer is rewired exactly once, so the algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ extra space — an efficient alternative to building a new reversed list, which would cost $O(n)$ additional memory.

## Queue Operations Sllist

A queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) collection: the earliest element inserted is the first one removed, mirroring a checkout line. The two core operations are $\text{add}(x)$, which inserts $x$ at the back, and $\text{remove}()$, which deletes and returns the element at the front. A singly linked list (SLList) implements both in $O(1)$ time — provided the list maintains explicit pointers to both its head and tail, not just the head.

**Why both pointers matter.** An SLList node stores a value and a single `next` reference. Removing the front element is naturally cheap: set `head = head.next` and return the old head's value — no traversal required, so $\text{remove}()$ costs $O(1)$. Adding to the *front* would also be $O(1)$, but a queue requires inserting at the *back*. Without a tracked tail, $\text{add}(x)$ would need to walk the entire list to find the last node, costing $O(n)$. The fix is to cache a `tail` pointer alongside `head`: to add $x$, create a new node, set `tail.next = newNode`, then update `tail = newNode`. Both operations now touch only the pointers involved, independent of list length — genuinely $O(1)$, not just amortized.

**Worked example.** Start with an empty queue: `head = tail = null`. Call $\text{add}(3)$: since the list is empty, `head` and `tail` both point to the new node holding 3. Call $\text{add}(7)$: `tail.next` (node 3's `next`) is set to the new node holding 7, then `tail` moves to that node. The list is now `3 → 7`. Call $\text{remove}()$: it returns 3 and advances `head` to the node holding 7. The list correctly reflects FIFO order — 3 arrived first and left first.

**Problem-solving application.** A subtle edge case is removing the last remaining element: after `head = head.next`, `head` becomes `null`, but `tail` still references the deleted node — a dangling reference. Correct implementations must check `if (head == null) tail = null;` after every removal to preserve the invariant "`tail` is `null$ if and only if the queue is empty." Forgetting this check is a classic bug: the next $\text{add}(x)$ would silently attach `x` after the stale, disconnected node, corrupting the structure. This invariant-maintenance step is exactly the kind of detail that separates a correct $O(1)$ implementation from one that merely looks correct on non-empty inputs.

## Payoff

A queue built on a singly linked list is the point at which a data structure course stops teaching structure for its own sake and starts teaching *guaranteed performance under a contract*. The contract is first-in-first-out ordering, and the achievement is that every operation honoring that contract — `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek` — runs in worst-case constant time, $O(1)$, provided the list maintains both a head and a tail pointer. Without the tail pointer, enqueue degrades to $O(n)$ because you must walk the list to find the last node; the entire pedagogical point of this concept is recognizing that a single extra reference converts a linear-time bottleneck into a constant-time guarantee. This is why it sits at the end of the linked-list unit rather than the beginning: it requires you to already understand node allocation, pointer reassignment, and the head/tail bookkeeping that earlier sections on singly linked lists built up piece by piece.

That $O(1)$ guarantee is precisely what makes the queue the substrate underneath a surprising range of systems. In algorithm design, it is the engine of breadth-first search and level-order tree traversal, where the invariant "process nodes in the order discovered" is exactly FIFO semantics — swap the queue for a stack and you get depth-first search instead, so the choice of structure *is* the choice of algorithm. In operating systems, the ready queue that a CPU scheduler consumes, and the buffer that absorbs a producer writing data faster than a consumer can read it, both depend on enqueue and dequeue never blocking on a hidden linear scan. In networking, packet buffers at a router interface are queues under time pressure: if dequeue were $O(n)$, throughput would collapse exactly when load is highest. In each domain, the correctness of the higher-level system rests on a guarantee proved at this lower level.

Pick one of these — BFS traversal, CPU scheduling, or packet buffering — and trace how the abstract `enqueue`/`dequeue` calls you just implemented become the concrete backbone of a real algorithm or system; the implementation you write here does not change when you get there.
